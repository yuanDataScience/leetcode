    "* Another subtle difference that tells a divide-and-conquer algorithm apart from other recursive algorithms is that we break the problem down into two or more subproblems in the divide-and-conquer algorithm, rather than a single smaller subproblem. The latter recursive algorithm sometimes is called decrease and conquer instead, such as Binary Search.\n",
    "* There are in general three steps that one can follow in order to solve the problem in a divide-and-conquer manner.\n",

    "* Overall, the enumeration of candidates is done in two levels: 1). at the first level, the function is implemented as recursion. At each occurrence of recursion, the function is one step further to the final solution.  2). at the second level, within the recursion, we have an iteration that allows us to explore all the candidates that have the same distance to the final solution.\n",
    "* The backtracking should happen at the level of the iteration within the recursion. \n",
    "* Unlike brute-force search, in backtracking algorithms we are often able to determine if a partial solution candidate is worth exploring further (i.e. is_valid(next_candidate)), which allows us to prune the search zones. This is also known as the constraint, e.g. the attacking zone of queen in N-queen game. \n",
    "* There are two symmetric functions that allow us to mark the decision (place(candidate)) and revert the decision (remove(candidate)).  "

    "#### Leetcode 489. Robot Room Cleaner\n",
    "* Overview\n",
    "  + You are controlling a robot that is located somewhere in a room. The room is modeled as an m x n binary grid where 0 represents a wall and 1 represents an empty slot.\n",
    "  + The robot starts at an unknown location in the room that is guaranteed to be empty, and you do not have access to the grid, but you can move the robot using the given API Robot.\n",
    "  + You are tasked to use the robot to clean the entire room (i.e., clean every empty cell in the room). The robot with the four given APIs can move forward, turn left, or turn right. Each turn is 90 degrees.\n",
    "  + When the robot tries to move into a wall cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle, and it stays on the current cell.\n",
    "  + Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using the following APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "    interface Robot {\n",
    "      // returns true if next cell is open and robot moves into the cell.\n",
    "      // returns false if next cell is obstacle and robot stays on the current cell.\n",
    "      boolean move();\n",
    "\n",
    "      // Robot will stay on the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.\n",
    "      // Each turn will be 90 degrees.\n",
    "      void turnLeft();\n",
    "      void turnRight();\n",
    "\n",
    "      // Clean the current cell.\n",
    "      void clean();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* General Algorithm\n",
    "  + The challenge is to track the positions and directions of robots during exploration\n",
    "    + we just use turn right function to exploare the space\n",
    "    + using backtrack for each recursive call, so that      \n",
    "      + when all four dirctions are exhuasted, then recursive call returns\n",
    "        + we first go back, and then turn right to explore\n",
    "    + It is important that the four directions are in order of up, right, down and left\n",
    "      + by doing this, we first explore in a clock-wise way to clean new cells, then anti-clock wise\n",
    "      + once all new cells in a region is cleaned, then turn right, this will lead to go back\n",
    "      + during the moving back, check the neighbours in up, right, down, left order to explore new cells. \n",
    "      + two situations\n",
    "        + one is that when all the four directions in for loop finish, will recursive back\n",
    "        + the other is when one direction is exhausted, it first go back (turn right twice and move, and then turn right twice)\n",
    "        + in for loop, the direction is defined by d (current direction + new_d in clock wise direction, this corresponds to turn right after each iteration inside the for loop. \n",
    "        + In either the case when the current direction is not avaialbe (move() returns False), or the current position has been expored with its neighbours and goback, we turn right to explore the next position AT THE SAME LEVEL\n",
    "        ![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "* Time complexity\n",
    "  + O(N-M) where N and M are the number of cells and the number of obstacles, respectively\n",
    "    + for each empty cells, we explore 4 directios, so it will be 4(N-M), which has O(N-M)\n",
    "* Space complexity\n",
    "  + O(N-M). we store all the empty cells that are cleaned\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Implementation notes\n",
    "  + the row and column indices correspond to y and x coordinates. \n",
    "  + define a diction array to define the up, right, down and left\n",
    "  + each time a direction is finished, the next dirction is (d+1) % 4\n",
    "  + explore(i, j, d) is called only for cell(i, j) is empty and not been clened. Therefore, we will first add (i, j) into the visited set, and then explore its four neighbors\n",
    "    + directions are explored by adding 0, 1, 2, 3 to the current d mod by 4, so basically, the direction along the original direction will be tried, and then the next clock-wise direction\n",
    "    + it is important to pass the direction to explore() function for its recursive chain so that depending on its direction, the following recusions will continue to explore in clock-wise directions\n",
    "    + once a recusion call is returned, use go_back() function to go back to (i, j) cell with its original direction\n",
    "  + in both case that a new coordination (x, y) is valid or not, we need to use robot.turnRight() to change the direction to the next one consistent to the move direction defined in moves(new_d) statement in for loop  \n",
    "  + different from typical backtracking problem, we don't remove the tried cells from the visited set "

    "#### Leetcode 218. The Skyline Problem\n",
    "* Overview\n",
    "  + A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings\\[i\\] = \\[lefti, righti, heighti\\]:\n",
    "    + lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.\n",
    "    + righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.\n",
    "    + heighti is the height of the ith building.\n",
    "  + You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.\n",
    "  + The skyline should be represented as a list of \"key points\" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form \\[\\[x1,y1],[x2,y2\\],...\\]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.\n",
    "  + Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, \\[...,\\[2 3\\],\\[4 5\\],\\[7 5\\],\\[11 5\\],\\[12 7\\],...\\] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: \\[...,\\[2 3\\],\\[4 5\\],\\[12 7\\],...\\]\n",
    "* Algorithm (Divide and conquer implementation)\n",
    "  + This implementation is the same as merge sort. We recursively separate the build lists provided (for example, contains n builidings) to smaller list until we have one element in each sublist, where, the three parameters are converted to two edges, one with the \\[start, heigh\\], the other has \\[end, 0\\]. Here start and end refert to each buildings start and end indices on x dimesion.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + Then we call merge function to merge the sublist using the same logic as merge sort. The basic idea is that we first compare the x dimension of the current element of left and right sublists, and define the current update x value as the smaller of the two. (if the two x are the same, we focus on right one), and then we find the current y as the maximum of the current left and right. If this max-y is different from the current y, then we update the current y and the profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "  + The key point is that due to the merge sort process, all the building input have been converted to edges. in the left or right sublist, unless the next element in the same sublist that changes the current left_y or right_y, these values are supposed to continue in the current comparision, therefore max_y is always the max between left_y and right_y, unless the next edge in the same sublist replace it. Therefore, we can safely assume that when updating the rs (this is a clean list each time when merge is called), the current x will either equals to the top element in result stack, or bigger. This is because we compare the x in the first step during the merge process, and there is no \"history\" records before the current merge function.\n",
    "    + if previous x is from left, and the current x is from right x, its righ y value will be compared to the existing left y value. \n",
    "  + several points:\n",
    "    + during the merge, whenever left and right don't have the same x value, use the smaller one and increament the corresponding pointer. Otherwise, needs to increament both pointers, and let the two y values to compete, and use the high one.\n",
    "    + we initialize left\\_y = right\\_y = 0, which is smaller than any possible y values. This ensures that at the begining of the merge, the smaller of left\\_x and right\\_x will have its corresponding y value be selected as max\\_y\n",
    "    + then for the next iteration of comparison, the newly selected left\\_y or right\\_y will be compared to the \n",
    "    + we only need to update the result list when the current max_y is different from the the last element in the result, otherwise, we just keep the current value, sicne all the edge only recored the start coordination and the corresponding y value. Even if the current x is bigger than the last element in the result, we still don't need to update, until a later x in one of the sublist has a different y value, we update. This will guarantee to happen, since we know the last element of each sublist will have a y value of zero\n",
    "    + need to remember the pattern for merge sort:\n",
    "      a. the while loop only handles when both sublists are not completed\n",
    "\t  b. after the while loop, consider the remaining sublist. This MUST BE OUT OF WHILE LOOP\n",
