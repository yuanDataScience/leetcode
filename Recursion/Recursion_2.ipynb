    "* A divide-and-conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking the problem down into two or more subproblems of the same or related type, until these subproblems become simple enough to be solved directly. Then one combines the results of subproblems to form the final solution.\n",
    "* Another subtle difference that tells a divide-and-conquer algorithm apart from other recursive algorithms is that we break the problem down into two or more subproblems in the divide-and-conquer algorithm, rather than a single smaller subproblem. The latter recursive algorithm sometimes is called decrease and conquer instead, such as Binary Search.\n",
    "* There are in general three steps that one can follow in order to solve the problem in a divide-and-conquer manner.\n",
    "  1. Divide. Divide the problem S into a set of subproblems: {S1, S2,...Sn} where nâ‰¥2, i.e. there are usually more than one subproblem.\n",
