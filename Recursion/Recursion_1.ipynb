    "### Principle of Recursion\n",
    "* A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop\n",
    "  + A simple base case (or cases), which is a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer\n",
    "  + A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case\n",
    "* Example\n",
    "  + how to print a string in reverse order\n",
    "    + we use recursive stack to print each letter when recusively called function returned from the end of the string as a None\n",
    "    + this example take advantage of the recursive stack, which can be easily converted to an iteration version using a stack, but to store letter in each recursive call consumes extra space, so will not be a space complexity of O(1) algorithm\n",
    "    + the function starts to fetch letters when index goes to n-1, and we want to modify the index 0 of the input character list, so we use n-1-index\n",
    "  + another commonly used algorithm is to exchange letters until the mid of the string  \n",
    "    + we can implement this either iteratively or recursively"
