    "#### Leetcode 622. Design Circular Queue\n",
    "* Overview\n",
    "  + Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called \"Ring Buffer\".\n",
    "  + One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.\n",
    "  + Implement the MyCircularQueue class:\n",
    "    + MyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.\n",
    "    + int Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\n",
    "    + int Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\n",
    "    + boolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.\n",
    "    + boolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.\n",
    "    + boolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.\n",
    "    + boolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.\n",
