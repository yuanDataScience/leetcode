    "### Heap Sort\n",
    "* starting from selection sort, which find the minimum element starting from the current sorting position, and then exchange that min element to the sorting position\n",
    "  + this takes O(n^2) sicne each scan takes O(N), and you basically need to scan for each sorting poistion, which is also at O(N) level\n",
    "* we can use Heap to simplify the scan process \n",
    "* algorithm of heap sort\n",
    "  + convert the unsorted array into a binary tree\n",
    "  + bottom up heapify unordered list. scanning from the end of the array, compare its value to its children if it has children, and exchange with the bigger child node if the child's value is bigger than its value, and sip down if necessary to maintain the max Heap\n",
    "  + exhange the top element with the last element, and decrease the heap size to exclude the last element from the Max Heap. The excluded part is a partially sorted array\n",
    "  + sip down the top element to maintain the max heap, and then exchange the top with the last node, decrement the heap size, maintain the Max Heap, and repeat until all elements are sorted\n",
    "* time complexity\n",
    "  + O(NlogN)\n",
    "    + first time heapify is O(N)\n",
    "    + each time the max element is find and deleted from Heap, is O(logN)\n",
    "    + to sort all elements requires O(NlogN)\n",
    "    + O(N) + O(NlogN) = O(NlogN)\n",
    "* advantages and disadvantages\n",
    "  + generally much faster than the other comparison based sorts on sufficiently large inputs as a consequence of the running time\n",
    "  + not a stable sort\n",
    "  + in practice, peforms are worse than other O(NlogN) sorting algoritms due to bad cache locality properties\n",
    "    + + swaps elements based on locations in heaps, which can cause many read operatons to access indices in a seeming random order, causing many cache misses\n",
    "* implementation of algorithm in the following code\n",
    "  + max_heapify(heap_size, index) operate as a heap down process\n",
    "    + for node index, find its children and exchange its value with the bigger child if that child is bigger than it's value\n",
    "    + the largest after exchange refers to the child node after exchange, recursively call max_heapify to check the tree going down\n",
    "  + in the process to heapify the unsorted array, traverse all nodes from len(list)//2 -1 up to node 0)\n",
    "  + then loop from len(list)-1, to node 1, note that we exchange element of index i with index 0, and i = heap size -1, after exchange, we update the heap size by i in max_heapify(i, 0) to sip down the now top element to the heap with the size of i "
