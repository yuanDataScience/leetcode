    "* a Heap is not the same as a priority queue\n",
    "  + A priority queue is an abstract data type, which a Heap is a data structure \n",
    "  + A heap is not a priority queue, but a way to implement a priority queue\n",
    "* there are multiple ways to implement a priority queue, such as array or linked list. These implementation only guarantee O(1) time complexity for either insertion or deletion, while the other operation will have a time complexity of O(N)\n",

    "#### Definition of Heap\n",
    "* Heap is a special type of binary tree that meets the following criteria:\n",

    "  + the max/min value in the Heap can be obtained with O(1) time complexity\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Classification of Heap\n",
    "* max Heap: Each node in the Heap has a value no less than its child nodes. Therefore, the top element (root node) has the largest value in the Heap\n",
    "* min Heap: Each node in the Heap has a value no greater than its child nodes. Therefore, the top element (root node) has the smallest value in the Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heap Insertion and Deletion\n",
    "* insertion means adding an element to the Heap. After inserting the element, the properties of the Heap should remain unchanged\n",
