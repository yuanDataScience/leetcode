    "## Strategic Approach to DP\n",
    "### Framework for DP Problems\n",
    "* first step is to define the state\n",
    "  + A state is a set of variables taht can sufficiently describe a scenario\n",
    "  + among a set of state variables, we only care about relevant ones\n",
    "  + in Climbing Stairs (Leetcode 70), we only care about the current step. \n",
    "    + If i=6, we are describing the state of being on the 6th step\n",
    "    + every unique value of i represents a unique state\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### The Framework\n",
    "To solve a DP problem, we need to combine 3 things:\n",
    "+ a function or data structure that will compute/contain the answer to the problem for every give state\n",
    "  + For Climbing Stairs, let's say we have an function dp where dp(i) returns the number of ways to climb to the ith step. Solving the original problem would be as easy as return dp(n)\n",
    "  + How did we decide on the design of the function? The problem is asking \"How many distinct ways can you climb to the top?\", so we decide that the function will represent how many distinct ways you can climb to a certain step - literally the original problem, but generalized for a given state.\n",
    "  + Typically, top-down is implemented with a recursive function and hash map, whereas bottom-up is implemented with nested for loops and an array. When designing this function or array, we also need to decide on state variables to pass as arguments. This problem is very simple, so all we need to describe a state is to know what step we are currently on i\n",
    "+ A recurrence relation to transition between states\n",
    "  + A recurrence relation is an equation that relates different states with each other\n",
    "  + Let's say that we needed to find how many ways we can climb to the 30th stair. Well, the problem states that we are allowed to take either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Logically, that means to climb to the 30th stair, we arrived from either the 28th or 29th stair. Therefore, the number of ways we can climb to the 30th stair is equal to the number of ways we can climb to the 28th stair plus the number of ways we can climb to the 29th stair.\n",
    "  + The problem is, we don't know how many ways there are to climb to the 28th or 29th stair. However, we can use the logic from above to define a recurrence relation. In this case, \n",
    "    + dp(i) = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2)\n",
    "    + As you can see, information about some states gives us information about other states\n",
    "+ Base cases so that our recurrence relation doesn't go on infinitely\n",
    "  + The equation dp(i) = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2) on its own will continue forever to negative infinity. WE need base cases so that the function will eventually return a actual number\n",
    "  + Finding the base cases is often the easiest part of solving a DP problem, and just involves a little bit of logical thinking. When coming up with the base case(s) ask yourself: What state(s) can I find the answer to without using dynamic programming? In this example, we can reason that there is only 1 way to climb to the first stair (1 step once), and there are 2 ways to climb to the second stair (1 step twice and 2 steps once). Therefore, our base cases are\n",

    "    + dp(2) = 2 \n",

    "  1. Start with a completed top-down implementation\n",
    "  2. Initialize an array dp that is sized according to your state variables. For example, let's say the input to the problem was an array nums and an integer k that represents the maximum number of actions allowed. Your array dp would be 2D with one dimension of length nums.length and the other of lengthk. The values should be initialized as some default value opposite of what the problem is asking for. For example, if the problem is asking for the maximum of something, set the values to negative infinity. If it is asking for the minimum of something, set the values to infinity\n",
    "  3. Set your base cases, same as the ones you are using in your top-down function. Recall in House Robber, dp(0) = nums\\[0\\] and dp(1) = max(nums\\[0\\], nums\\[1\\]). In bottom-up, dp\\[0\\] = nums\\[0\\] and dp\\[1\\] = max(nums\\[0\\], nums\\[1\\])\n",
    "  4. Write a for-loop(s) that iterate over your state variables. If you have multiple state variables, you will need nested for-loops. These loops should start iterating from the base cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. Now, each iteration of the inner-most loop represents a given state, and is equivalent to a function call to the same state in top-down. Copy the logic from your function into the for-loop and change the function calls to accessing your array. All dp(...) changes into dp\\[...\\]\n",
    "  6. We're done! dp is now an array populated with the answer to the original problem for all possible states. Return the answer to the original problem, by changing return dp(...) to return dp\\[...\\]"
