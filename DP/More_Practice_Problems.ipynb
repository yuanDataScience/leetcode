    "### Leetcode 714 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee\n",
    "* overview\n",
    "  + given an array prices where prices\\[i\\] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.\n",
    "  + Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.\n",
    "* this is a similar best time to buy and sell stock series problem\n",
    "  + initialize a 2d dp array of n+1 and 2 elements on the two dimensions. The last element is the base case corresponding to 0 profit for both holding and unholding\n",
    "  + traverse from n-1 to 0. For each iteration, traverse holding variable from 0 to 1\n",
    "  + first assign dp(i)(j) = dp(i+1)(j) corresponding to do-nothing option\n",
    "  + then process the holding == 1 and holding ==0 cases separately\n",
    "    + if holding == 1, then dp(i)(j) = max(dp(i+1)(0)+prices(i)-fee, dp(i)(j)). This is to find the max between holding the stock and sell the stock at day i\n",
    "    + if holding == 0, then dp(i)(j) = max(dp(i+1)(1)-prices(i), dp(i)(j)). This is to find the max between buy the stock at day i and not buy stock\n",
    "  + finally, return dp(0)(0)\n",
    "* the key point of this type of problem is that we only focus on the current day (day i)'s option of whether keeping the current holding status or change it, and then connect the corresponding status on the next day, and find the max\n",
    "  + you can image by connectig all these status, the max option of the original status, which here is day 0, noholding will be obtained\n",
    "* time complexity: O(n) where n the length of prices\n",
