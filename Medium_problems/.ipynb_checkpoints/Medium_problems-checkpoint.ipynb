    "### Leetcode 89. Gray Code\n",
    "* Overview \n",
    "  + An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2n integers where:\n",
    "    + Every integer is in the inclusive range `[0, 2n - 1]`,\n",
    "    + The first integer is 0,\n",
    "    + An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,\n",
    "    + The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and\n",
    "    + The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.\n",
    "  + Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Algorithm (DP)\n",
    "  + the basic logic is that if there exists a set of numbers that differ by one bit, then adding 1 to the highest bit of these numbers in reversed order will generate another set of numbers that differ by one bit\n",
    "  + staring from 0, we construct a number differ by one bit from 0 using 0 | 1 << 0 = 1\n",
    "  + now we have (0, 1), if we add 1 bit to the highest bit of 1 and 0, we get (00, 01, 11, 10)\n",
    "  + the logic is that when we add the highest 1 to `dp[i]`, we are sure the new number differ from `dp[i]` by exactly one bit, then we add the highest 1 to `dp[i-1]`, since we `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i]` differs by one bit, we know the two new numbers will differ by one bit \n",
    "  + why use reversed(dp)? \n",
    "    + This can make sure the first number obtained in each for loop when adding one bit will have exactly one bit difference from its previous number. for example when switch from 01 to 11 where the highest 1 is added to 01 and 00, we need to make sure the switch between 01 and 11 is good. We know 11 and 10 will be OK since 01 and 00 is OK\n",
    "* Time and space complexity\n",
    "  + time complexity O(2^n) \n",
    "  + space complexity O(2^n)\n",
    "  + since for a give n, there will be 2^n numbers. So we have to generate these numbers using 2^n operations and store them using 2^n space"
