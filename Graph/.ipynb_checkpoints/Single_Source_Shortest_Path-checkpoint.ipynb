    "* limitations\n",
    "  + dijkstra algorithm only works for graphs where all the weights are positive. This is because in each round when we choose the vertex with shortest path, we know it must be the shortest path for that vertex, since paths from other vertices are already at least equal to this path, and any other path from these vertices to this vertex must add extra vertices, which is sure to be longer due to the positive weights of all the edges. However, if the edge weights can be negative, this will not be valid\n",
