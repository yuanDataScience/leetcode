    "  + in a deque, visit each course (vertex) with an in-degree of zero and decrement the in-degree of all courses that have this course as a prerequisite (outgoing edges). In the worst case, we will visit every vertex and decrement every outgoing edge once. Thus, this step will take O(V+E) time. The queue will take at most O(V) space\n",
