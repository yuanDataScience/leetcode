    "## Topological Sorting\n",
    "### Overview of Kahn's Algorithm\n",
    "* Topological sorting provides a linear sorting based on the required ordering between vertices in directed acyclic graphs\n",
    "  + to be specific, given vertices u and v, to reach v, we must have reached vertex u first\n",
    "    + in topological sorting, u has to appear before v in the ordering\n",
    "* the most popular algorithm for topological sorting is Kahn's algorithm\n",
    "* BFS algorithm\n",
    "  + build an adjacency list that stores the strict prerequisite courses for each course by traversing the edges. This step has O(E) for both time and space complexities. This step also store the in-degree for each course that takes O(V) space\n",
    "    + time complexity is O(E), space complexity is O(E+V) for this step\n",
    "  + in a deque, visit each course (vertex) with an in-degree of zero and decrement the in-degree of all courses that have this course as a prerequisite (outgoing edges). In the worst case, we will visit every vertex and decrement every outgoing edge once. Thus, this step will take O(V+E) time. The queue will take at most O(V) space\n",
    "  + time complexity:\n",
    "    O(V+E) + O(E) = O(V+E)\n",
    "  + space complexity\n",
    "    O(V) + O(E+V) = O(E+V)\n",
    "    \n",
    "* DFS algorithm\n",
    "  + Option 1: For each node, if it has indegrees of value zero, then recursively call dfs in the first implementation\n",
    "  + Option 2: USe color state tracking, we set a is_acyclic to track if there is a cycle\n",
    "    + If there is a cycle, we will not continue the dfs, since we will return empty list\n",
    "    + If the current vertex is white, we will change it to grey, and traverse its neighbors\n",
    "      + if the neighbor is white, recursively call dfs on the neighbor\n",
    "      + if the neighbor is grey, we detect a cycle, we set the is_acyclic to False and return\n",
    "      + set the color of the current vertex to BLACK and add it to the result (this occurs only when all its neighbors are returned without a cycle detected\n",
    "    + return the reverse order of the result \n",
    "    \n",
    "* limitatios\n",
    "  + only works with graphs that are directed and acyclic.\n",
    "  + Must be at least one vertex in the “graph” with an “in-degree” of 0. If all vertices in the “graph” have a non-zero “in-degree”, then all vertices need at least one vertex as a predecessor. In this case, no vertex can serve as the starting vertex, as in a cycle.    "
