    "* What is binary search\n",
    "  + It describes the process of searching for a specific value in an ordered collection\n",
    " * Terminology used in Binary Search\n",
    "   + Target - the value that you are searching for\n",
    "   + Index - the current location that you are searching\n",
    "   + Left, Right - the indices from which we use to maintain our search space\n",
    "   + Mid - the index that we use to apply a condition to determine if we should search left or right\n",
    "* How does it work?\n",
    "  + In its simplest form, Binary Search operates on a contiguous sequence with a specified left and right index, which is called the search space\n",
    "  + Binary Search maintains the left, right, and middle indicies of the search space and compares the search target or applies the search condition to the middle value of the collection\n",
    "  + if the condition is unsatisfied or values unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful\n",
    "  + If the search ends with an empty half, the condition cannot be fulfilled and target is not found."

    "* Overview\n",
    "  + Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers\\[index1\\] and numbers\\[index2\\] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.\n",
    "  + Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array \\[index1, index2\\] of length 2.\n",
    "  + The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.\n",
    "  + Your solution must use only constant extra space.\n",

    "#### Leetcode 287. Find the Duplicate Number\n",
    "* Overview\n",
    "  + Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range \\[1, n\\] inclusive.\n",
    "  + There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.\n",
    "  + You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.\n",
    "* Algorithm\n",
    "  + the general idea is to compare the properites of the nums with the idea array where only elements in \\[1, n\\] are included. These properties include:\n",
    "    + the number of 1s in different bit positions from bit 0 (right most) to bit 31\n",
    "    + the count of elements <= the current element. In idea list, this count should always equals to the value of the current element (there should be 1 element <= 1, 2 counts <= 2, etc.) we need to find the first element index that having counts > then its value\n",
    "    + for repeated elements, if we draw the flowchart of element's value traversed by the index of elements, there will be a cycle, as shown below. Note that entry point of the cycle is defined by the value of element\n",
    "    ![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "  + based on the three properties, there are three algorithms\n",
    "    + bit by bit\n",
    "      + scan bit position from 0 to 31 as b, \n",
    "        + we right shift each element by the bit position, and count the sum of 1s for each bit position and assign it as a (actual)\n",
    "        + we right shift each number from 1 to n as in the idea list, and count the sum of 1s for each bit position, and assign it as e (expected)\n",
    "      + if e > a, we add rs |= 1 << b (we don't care the exact difference between e and a, we only care if there is a 1 at the b position)\n",
    "    return rs  \n",
    "    + binary search\n",
    "      + for numbers in the range of 1 and n, if repeated number happens at i, then all the count of elements <= i will be bigger its value\n",
    "        + we don't care numbers where count <= value, since we only care the repeated number. when count< value, some numbers <= the current values are missing, which is not what the question is asking\n",
    "      + we need to find the first element index of the pattern where the count > its value\n",
    "    + two points\n",
    "      + same as the cyclic linked list detection problem. We set fast and slow pointers. Fast pointer goes two steps and slow pointer goes one step each time\n",
    "      + we fisrt find the point where both pointers point to the same element, then initialize the fast pointer to the head of the list, and find the position where both pointers overlap again, which is the answer"
