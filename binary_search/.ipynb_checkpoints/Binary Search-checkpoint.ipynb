    "* What is binary search\n",
    "  + It describes the process of searching for a specific value in an ordered collection\n",
    " * Terminology used in Binary Search\n",
    "   + Target - the value that you are searching for\n",
    "   + Index - the current location that you are searching\n",
    "   + Left, Right - the indices from which we use to maintain our search space\n",
    "   + Mid - the index that we use to apply a condition to determine if we should search left or right\n",
    "* How does it work?\n",
    "  + In its simplest form, Binary Search operates on a contiguous sequence with a specified left and right index, which is called the search space\n",
    "  + Binary Search maintains the left, right, and middle indicies of the search space and compares the search target or applies the search condition to the middle value of the collection\n",
    "  + if the condition is unsatisfied or values unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful\n",
    "  + If the search ends with an empty half, the condition cannot be fulfilled and target is not found."
